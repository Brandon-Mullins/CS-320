How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?
I make sure my code is functional by writing detailed unit tests that cover both valid and invalid inputs. I test positive cases to confirm the program works correctly and negative cases to make sure it fails properly when it should. For security, I validate all input data, avoid hardcoding sensitive information, and use good coding practices to keep the program safe.
How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
I focus on reading the requirements closely and turning each one into a real part of the code. If a user needs a 10-character ID, I add checks to make sure it happens. I also think about what users expect — like being able to create a contact without worrying about broken features — and design the program around meeting those expectations.
How do I approach designing software?
I usually start by breaking down what the program needs to do into small parts. I write model classes first, then service classes that handle logic, and finally unit tests. I reuse validation logic by putting it in setter methods to avoid repetition. I also focus on clean code and modular design so the program is easier to maintain or update later.
